     <h2>Engagement with Learning<div id="div_1"></div></h2>
     <p>
         Online resources provide a variety of learning styles for students, leading to greater engagement from students who may not learn as well in a traditional style.
         This has helped keep students more engaged for longer periods of time with particular improvements in STEM subjects. 
         This has lead to rapid development of education technology such as mobile apps, websites and hardware like interactive whiteboards and tablets.
         Many technologies are still being developed for education such as AI-based tutoring systems.

     <h2>Preparation for the Future<div id="div_2"></div></h2>
     <p>
         With increasing automation of the workplace, many jobs which may not have had a digital element in the past are likely to have one in the future.
         As such, use of technology in education is useful in preparation of skills that will be valuable for many jobs.
     <h2>Access to Knowledge<div id="div_3"></div></h2>
         <p>
            The internet has become an invaluable source for research in schools, universities and all other areas of education.
            Information and data can now be shared very quickly and easily at any time for greater collaborative efforts on problems. 
            Search engines have also played a big role in providing easy access to this information and in allowing students to access educational resources from home as well as in the classroom.
            With so many people now able to access the internet, there has also been a rise in online courses. 
            This has allowed people to access learning resources at a time that suits them and encourages further learning as virtual lessons become more and more prevalent and people all over the world being able to watch lectures via the internet.

     <h2> Environmental Benefits<div id="div_4"></div></h2>
         <p>
             Computer Science has lead to a reduction in use of paper in education through use of online materials, eReaders, submition of work by email and cloud storage for documents which helps reduce the rate of deforestation and reduce costs.
